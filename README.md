## Let's Get Started

* It's better to clone or download the project.
* Always before writing codes make sure that all the assets (images, fonts, etc) are added in the project directory.


Skip this step if you have cloned or downloaded this project from github:

1. Create a fonts directory and add required fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Create a images directory and paste required images.

3. Now edit the pubspec.yaml (images are added under assets section and fonts are added under fonts section ). 
4. Now run Get Packages to successfully commit your changes.

5. Create a 'helper' directory inside 'lib' directory and add model class (structure class) and models class ( list of models with custom get method).
6. Now create  a 'ui' directory inside 'lib' directory and add your custom UI. For better look add Ui widget of this project.
7. Now set your home of Material App as UI widget.
